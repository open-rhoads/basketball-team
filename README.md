# San Diego Surf Basketball Team Site

This project utilizes semantic HTML with the use of microdata & Wai-Aria. 
It creates a responsive layout using the Bootstrap flexbox framework. 
It minimizes CSS specificity and leverages pseudo-classes/elements, transitions and a custom animation.

## Dynamic Header and Footer
After much frustration over having to update the common elements of this older project on every single page, I saved myself from ever having to do that again by creating a dynamically displayed header and footer.

## Dynamic Statistics Table
The Statistics page is generated dynamically and pulls API data to populate the table with realistic team statistics.

## Dynamic Schedule
The calendar feature is also generated dynamically with JavaScript and will soon use API data to display game matches (as soon as my free plan to the API becomes available again).
